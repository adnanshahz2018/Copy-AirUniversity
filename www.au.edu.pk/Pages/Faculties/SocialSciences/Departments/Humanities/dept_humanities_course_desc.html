                                <p class="text-justify"> The purpose of this course is to provide a sequence of readings and learning experiences that will enable consistent application of theories of learning in designing classroom learning experiences, developing a classroom learning community, and assessing progress towards the expected student learning outcomes. Primary theories and perspectives related to learning, including behavioral, developmental, cognitive, social cognitive, socio-cultural, and constructivist learning theories will be covered. In addition, we examine how these different theories address student assessment, motivation, self-regulation, and classroom management. Course contents include: Guiding principles and methodology in a variety of approaches to the teaching of second languages; impact of culture, socioeconomic level and educational background on language and literacy development as well as human development processes and variations.

                                <p class="text-justify"> Cognitive Linguistics is the study of the mind through language and the study of language as a cognitive function. The course focuses on studying how cognitive mechanisms like memory, categorization, attention, and imagery are used during language behavior; and understanding  psychologically viable models of language that cover broad ranges of linguistic phenomena, including idioms and figurative language. Research in Cognitive Linguistics is multidisciplinary; evidence is drawn from text analysis, language acquisition, language change, psycholinguistic experimentation, and brain imaging, among other sources. The purpose of this course is to provide a general orientation in Cognitive Linguistics, an understanding of its central themes and assumptions, and exposure to its empirical methods.</p>
                            
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 91E - Functional English Level 1</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify"> Students who have completed 10 years of education [in their native language] are eligible to apply for this course. It is assumed that these students have a working knowledge of English language so that they follow the instructions in the classroom. Their vocabulary is limited and they cannot identify everyday items in the target language. They cannot form words by joining letters. Their reading exposure is limited (4-5 lettered words only). And if they can read they usually pronounce monosyllabic words correctly but have difficulty with disyllable and trisyllable words. They are not able to continue a conversation only in the target language and may code-switch from their first language to English by using a word or expression and therefore cannot sustain a conversation in the target language. They may distinguish between upper and lower cases, but would not be able to use them appropriately in their writings. All such difficulties will be dealt with in this course.</p>
                            
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 92E - Functional English Level 2</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify"> Students who have completed 12 years of formal education in their native language are eligible to apply for this course. Their secondary school education included English as a compulsory subject. Their communication in English comprises of broken sentences, and incomplete thought in the target language. They do possess a passive vocabulary of everyday items and expressions but are not able to connect thought to speech in the target language. They can form words of 6-7 letters but are unable to always structure a correct sentence. They have limited knowledge/understanding of transitional devices and this hampers their productivity at intra- and inter-sentential level. They may be able to read a text with simple vocabulary, but may not always comprehend it. They find it difficult to speak/pronounce words with disyllable and trisyllables. Code-switching due to better vocabulary is far more frequent than at the first level. Ability to build sentences in the target language is still limited. This course would help learners in all such aforementioned issues.</p>
                            
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 94E - Conversation Skills in English</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify"> Students who have completed at least 10 years of formal education are eligible to apply for this course. This course specifically addresses the need of learners who want to improve their conversation skills in English. They find it difficult to communicate in English due to reasons including: insufficient exposure to English language, dependence on first language to learn second/foreign language, reluctance due to lack of confidence, limited practice and absence of motivational factors. Due to these factors learners hamper at the intra- and inter-sentential level. This course will provide exposure to students in the target language through the direct method to reduce code-switching by providing conducive environment. The course targets at giving confidence to speakers and developing their presentation skills in English language through a variety of activities.</p>
                            
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 95E - Advanced Oral Communication</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify"> The course of Advanced Oral Communication (AOC) is designed to help learners who have insufficient exposure to English language reduce their dependence on the first language to learn and produce the language. In addition to it the learners find it difficult to sustain accuracy as well as fluency when they are dealing with debatable issues. ÊTo cater to these problems AOC is designed to provide information and opportunities to practice the skill in a variety of settings (relationships, groups, and public); direct method is used to reduce code switching, learners are supposed to present as individuals and as members of a small/large groups to build up their confidence, and audio/video aids are used along with numerous other activities to motivate learners to speak. Furthermore, visits to Language Lab are a constant feature of the course that enables learners to improve pronunciation, listening skills and make them independent learners.</p>
                            
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 97E - Certificate of Technical English</h4>
                                
                                    <p class="text-justify"> Students who have completed 12 years of formal education are eligible to apply for this course. The course particularly aims at addressing the needs of professionals who are at different stages of their career. Students can understand the basic language structure and are capable of formulating simple sentences in English, using simple expressions of everyday vocabulary and communicating English in the colloquial language. They find it difficult to understand a complex text as an organic whole due to limited readings and less opportunities to critically
                                    analyze texts in the target language. The course would help those who need to understand the correct use of technical vocabulary, the writing process, and application of technical documents like official letters, memos, emails, etc. The students will be given practice of language mechanics including aspects of grammar and their usage. Contextual comprehension will also be focused.</p>
                                
                                <h4 style="color:#1c3b79">HU 98E - Diploma in Technical English</h4>
                                <p class="text-justify"> Students who have completed 14 years of formal education and are recruits of some organization are the best candidates for this course. This course will enable learners to use English at advanced levels in business correspondence, technical presentations and field projects. Learners who join this course find it difficult to apply contextually to their vocabulary to technical documents. Students are given practice to strengthen their skills in writing persuasive letters of advanced level, proposals, and feasibility, progress and research reports. They are also guided how to be effective participants and presenters in formal meetings. Through projects/case studies students will be encouraged to learn problem-solving and information-processing.</p>
